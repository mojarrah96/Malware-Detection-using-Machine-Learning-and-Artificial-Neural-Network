# Malware Detection Using Machine Learning and 
This repository provides an intelligent approach for detecting malicious behavior and distinguishing between malware and benign software using various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Artificial Neural Metworks (ANN).

# Experimental Results:
1. Classical Machine Learning Algorithms:
    
    - All features with generating new one feature (md5_numeric: convert md5 hash into numerical values).
